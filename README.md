## budgetCalculator through React

### Highlights of the project

- Don't forget to run `npm install` before you run `npm start`. `npm install` will give you all the packages and scripts you need to run this application.
- A thing about `localStorage`. I had to face some errors that had to do with `Json.parse`, but clearing my `localStorage` seem to have fix that.
